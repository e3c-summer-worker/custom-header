# Custom Headers

This is a collection of the custom header code we are using at the [ecccchurch.ca](https://eccchurch.ca/) domain.

## Format

- [`main_original.html`](./main_original.html)
    Original code that is copy and pasted to the page header (page settings > advanced)
- [`main_proposal.html`](./main_proposal.html)
    Proposed new code that uses custom components via Elm.

## Developers:

Since I'm using two SSH keys to manage both github accounts, I have to use a different github address when using git pull and push stuff.

Instead of `git@github.com` I have to use `git@github.com-eccc_summer_worker`.
