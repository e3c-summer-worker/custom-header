# Custom Headers

This is a collection of the custom header code we are using at the [ecccchurch.ca](https://eccchurch.ca/) domain.


## Developers:

Since I'm using two SSH keys to manage both github accounts, I have to use a different github address when using git pull and push stuff.

Instead of `git@github.com` I have to use `git@github.com-eccc_summer_worker`.

See: [this blog post](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/manage-multiple-github-accounts-the-ssh-way-2dadc30ccaca/).
